//Drop-down menus let users click an icon, text field, or other component, and then select from a list of options on a temporary surface. 

üéØ What is a Drop-down Menu in Jetpack Compose?
* A Drop-down Menu is a UI component that allows users to select one (or more) options from a list that appears below a trigger, 
  usually a button or text.
* In Jetpack Compose, we typically implement it using:
  * ExposedDropdownMenuBox
  * DropdownMenu
  * DropdownMenuItem

üöÄ Why Use Drop-down Menus?
‚úÖ Need:
  * Compact selection of multiple values
  * Better UX for fixed-size data like gender, status, region, language, etc.

üìê SOLID Principle Compliance
| Principle                     | How it's applied                                            |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **S - Single Responsibility** | ViewModel handles data, Composable handles UI               |
| **O - Open/Closed**           | Can extend to use dynamic data or search functionality      |
| **L - Liskov Substitution**   | Replace drop-down with radio buttons or dialogs if needed   |
| **I - Interface Segregation** | Listeners only for what's needed (onClick, onDismiss)       |
| **D - Dependency Inversion**  | Compose doesn't depend on data source; ViewModel handles it |


üì± UI/UX Considerations
   * Use ExposedDropdownMenuBox for Material3 support.
   * Add a search box if the list is long.
   * Highlight selected item using colors or checkmarks.
   * Use Modifier.zIndex() if UI overlays improperly.

üß† Memory & Performance
   * Uses recomposition efficiently (only composables affected recompose).
   * Minimal overhead unless nested in heavy lists.
   * Avoid using in unscrollable containers to prevent overflow.


üìã Real-World Use Cases
| Feature           | Drop-down Use           |
| ----------------- | ----------------------- |
| Country Selection | Short country list      |
| Job Filter        | Categories dropdown     |
| Quiz/Survey App   | Answer choices          |
| Form Submission   | Age/Experience dropdown |
| Admin Panel UI    | Role selector, Status   |


üìå Summary
    ‚úÖ Drop-downs are intuitive, minimal & clean UI components.
    ‚úÖ Backed by DropdownMenu, DropdownMenuItem, and optionally ExposedDropdownMenuBox.
    ‚úÖ Supports MVVM, Flow, SOLID design.
    ‚úÖ Efficient on memory & performance.
    ‚úÖ Highly customizable.
    ‚úÖ Can use Singleton for static options.
    ‚úÖ ViewModel separation ensures maintainability.
