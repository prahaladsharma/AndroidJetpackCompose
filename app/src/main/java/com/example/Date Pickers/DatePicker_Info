Date pickers:--
    * A Date Picker is a UI component that allows users to select a date (day/month/year) from a calendar-like interface. 
    * In Jetpack Compose, we don’t have a built-in DatePicker yet, so we use Android’s traditional DatePickerDialog inside Compose.

1. Types:-
1.1 Docked:    ![Docked](image.png)
    * Appears inline within the layout. It's suitable for compact layouts where a dedicated dialog might feel intrusive.
1.2 Modal: ![Model](image-1.png)
    * Appears as a dialog overlaying the app's content. This provides a clear focus on date selection.
1.3 Modal input: ![Model Input](image-2.png)
    * Combines a text field with a modal date picker.
1.4 DatePicker Range:-  ![DatePicker Range](image-3.png)
    * You can create a date picker that lets the user select a range between a start and end date. To do so, use DateRangePicker.


* You can implement these date pickers in your app using the following composables:
    * DatePicker: General composable for a date picker. The container you use determines whether it is docked or model.
    * DatePickerDialog: The container for both modal and modal input date pickers.
    * DateRangePicker: For any date picker where the user can select a range with a start and end date.
