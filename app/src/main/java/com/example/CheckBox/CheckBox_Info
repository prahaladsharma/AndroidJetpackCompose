Checkboxes let users select one or more items from a list. You might use a checkbox to let the user do the following:
    * Turn an item on or off.
    * Select from multiple options in a list.
    * Indicate agreement or acceptance.

Anatomy:-
A checkbox consists of the following elements:
    * Box: This is the container for the checkbox.
    * Check: This is the visual indicator that shows whether the checkbox is selected or not.
    * Label: This is the text that describes the checkbox.    


States:-
A checkbox can be in one of three states:
    * Unselected: The checkbox is not selected. The box is empty.
    * Indeterminate: The checkbox is in an indeterminate state. The box contains a dash.
    * Selected: The checkbox is selected. The box contains a checkmark.

/**
* âœ… Best Practices:--
*  ðŸ”¹ Always pair a Checkbox with descriptive Text.
*  ðŸ”¹ Handle onCheckedChange separately in list items to avoid recomposition errors.
*  ðŸ”¹ Use rememberSaveable if state needs to persist across recompositions.
*  ðŸ”¹ Wrap checkboxes in a Row or Column for clean layouts.
